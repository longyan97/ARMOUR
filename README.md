**ARMOUR: Android Runtime Zero-permission Sensor Usage Monitoring from User Space**

<img src="./logo.png" alt="Developers" width="50">

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

ARMOUR is a lightweight Android privacy-enhancement tool for detecting **zero-permission sensor access** by third-party apps at runtime, directly from **user space**‚Äîno root, no permissions required. Just install ARMOUR on your device and start monitoring.

### üîç Motivation

Android's zero-permission sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer can be accessed without any user consent or notifications. Despite extensive works investigating how to collect more sensor data to enable various applications, little work has explored how to meet the needs of researchers and data providers to monitor and analyze the sensor usage.These zero-permission sensors pose various privacy risks, including the ability to infer location, activities, or sensitive inputs like keystrokes or voice patterns. ARMOUR helps **restore sensor data usage transparency** by allowing users and researchers to monitor such access.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

ARMOUR leverages a property of the Android sensor framework:

> üìà **Instant Sampling Rate Variation & Convergence Rule**  
> When multiple apps register for the same sensor, Android aligns them to the highest requested sampling rate. ARMOUR detects sensor access by measuring unexpected changes in its own sampling rate.

In short, ARMOUR requests the minimum supported sampling rates of zero-permission sensors on a device and **detect actual received instant sampling rates higher than the rates requested by ARMOUR, which reveals that another app is accessing these sensors with higher sampling rates**. ARMOUR works entirely in user space, requiring:
- No OS modifications
- No root privileges
- No app-specific reverse engineering



### üöÄ Features

- üß© Detects accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer usage. More zero-permission sensors can be easily added. 
- üïµÔ∏è Detects access from obfuscated, native-code, or even web-based apps
- üì± Works on Android 8.0+ (API 26+) without root
- ‚öôÔ∏è Runs quietly as a background service
- üîß Profiling mode to calibrate detection for your device

### üì¶ Installation

You can either install the prebuilt APK or build the project from source:

#### üîπ Option 1: Install Prebuilt APK
Download and install the APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/longyan97/ARMOUR/releases/tag/v1.0).

#### üîπ Option 2: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/armour.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure you have the necessary SDK and API levels installed:
   - Minimum SDK version: 29
   - Target SDK version: 34
   - Compile API Level: 35

### ‚û§ Step 1: Device Profiling

Run ARMOUR in profiling mode to determine the minimum supported sampling rates for each sensor on your device. This calibration ensures accurate detection thresholds.

1. Open ARMOUR.
2. Select **Profiling Mode**.
3. Wait for completion (~30 seconds).
4. Thresholds will be stored internally for later use. You can also manually change it later in the config menu.

### ‚û§ Step 2: Monitoring

Keep ARMOUR running in the background. Launch the third-party app you want to analyze.

1. Switch ARMOUR to **Monitoring Mode**.
2. Open the target app and interact with it.
3. ARMOUR will log changes in instant sampling rates.

### ‚û§ Step 3: Analyze Results

Collected data is stored locally on the device. Use ARMOUR's built-in log viewer or export logs to a PC for offline analysis.
